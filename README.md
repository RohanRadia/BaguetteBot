# BaguetteBot
A Discord Bot which we decided to name `Baguette Bot`! It was created to aid me when coding but eventually I decided to
work on the bot as a general moderation/aid tool to help streamline servers.

This project supports Python3+. The version that I (the author) am running the code on is version Python3.7 just for
reference.

Create a `.env` file and within it please include the following environment variables:

```
TOKEN=
OWNER=
PG_HOST=
PG_PORT=
PG_USER=
PG_PASS=
PG_DB=
```
